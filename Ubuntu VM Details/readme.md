# A Linux VM _ with NS2 pre-installed _

### Steps:

1. Install [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Install [Virtual Box Extension Pack](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.26/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-6.1.26.vbox-extpack).
3. Download the [.ova file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BsU2AQHOJee5s91HMbqbvJD-MFZfoaJ2/view?usp=sharing) via this drive link and simply run it.
4. The user id is vesit-student and the password is vesit, to log on to your new VM.

#### Now, simply go ahead, open up the Terminal and shoot 'ns', just to confirm you have the ns shell up and running. You can type in commands like nam to see what it looks like. Have fun!
